- Mouse over teammate's anima powers to see what they do.
- Toggle UI with commands or minimap button left-click.
- Reposition UI with drag-and-drop.
- Automatic rescaling on party size change, incase someone bails your group. :(

- Dynamic anima power resizing / pagination / scrollbar.
    -  Anything to make it so that the powers don't have to be so small to fit at the moment.
- More information on the UI, such as tracking some statistics about your runs.
    - Things to fill the empty space in lower party count / solo runs, basically.
