# TorghastTeams

TorghastTeams is your best friend when you're running Torghast, Tower of the Damned, with your buddies.
Currently displays up to 24 unique anima powers at once, more planned.

Commands:
- `/tgt, /torghastteams` - displays help message relating to commands
- `/tgt show` - displays the TorghastTeams UI
- `/tgt hide` - hides the TorghastTeams UI
- `/tgt minimap` - toggles display of the TorghastTeams minimap button

Features:
- View your, and your teammate's anima powers in real time in the UI.
- Mouse over teammate's anima powers to see what they do.
- Toggle UI with commands or minimap button left-click.
- Reposition UI with drag-and-drop.
- Automatic rescaling on party size change, incase someone bails your group. :(

Planned:
- Dynamic anima power resizing / pagination / scrollbar.
    -  Anything to make it so that the powers don't have to be so small to fit at the moment.
- More information on the UI, such as tracking some statistics about your runs.
    - Things to fill the empty space in lower party count / solo runs, basically.
- More user configuration settings, not sure what yet.
